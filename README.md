## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, EJS

I used Node and Express to create CRUD POST and GET routes in order to create and add objects into my MongoDB datatbase and to get that data from the same database.


## Lessons Learned:

I have a better understanding of what Express, Node, and MongoDB are used for. I've learned how to use CRUD methods to get/read objects and add objects to a MongoDB database.
